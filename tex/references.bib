	abstract = {Most data in genome-wide phylogenetic analysis (phylogenomics) is essentially multidimensional, posing a major challenge to human comprehension and computational analysis. Also, we can not directly apply statistical learning models in data science to a set of phylogenetic trees since the space of phylogenetic trees is not Euclidean. In fact, the space of phylogenetic trees is a tropical Grassmannian in terms of max-plus algebra. Therefore, to classify multi-locus data sets for phylogenetic analysis, we propose tropical support vector machines (SVMs). Like classical SVMs, a tropical SVM is a discriminative classifier defined by the tropical hyperplane which maximizes the minimum tropical distance from data points to itself in order to separate these data points into sectors (half-spaces) in the tropical projective torus. Both hard margin tropical SVMs and soft margin tropical SVMs can be formulated as linear programming problems. We focus on classifying two categories of data, and we study a simpler case by assuming the data points from the same category ideally stay in the same sector of a tropical separating hyperplane. For hard margin tropical SVMs, we prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for two categories of data points to be separated, and we show an explicit formula for the optimal value of the feasible linear programming problem. For soft margin tropical SVMs, we develop novel methods to compute an optimal tropical separating hyperplane. Computational experiments show our methods work well. We end this paper with open problems.},

    abstract = { Abstract. We present results on the number of linear regions of the functions that can be represented by artificial feedforward neural networks with maxout units. A rank- \(k\) maxout unit is a function computing the maximum of \(k\) linear functions. For networks with a single layer of maxout units, the linear regions correspond to the upper vertices of a Minkowski sum of polytopes. We obtain face counting formulas in terms of the intersection posets of tropical hypersurfaces or the number of upper faces of partial Minkowski sums, along with explicit sharp upper bounds for the number of regions for any input dimension, any number of units, and any ranks, in cases with and without biases. Based on these results we also obtain asymptotically sharp upper bounds for networks with multiple layers. }

	abstract = {We show that several decision problems origi-nating from max-plus or tropical convexity are equivalent to zero-sum, two player game problems. In particular, we set up an equivalence between the external representation of tropical convex sets and zero-sum stochastic games, in which tropical polyhedra correspond to deterministic games with finite action spaces. Then, we show that the winning initial positions can be determined from the associated tropical polyhedron. We obtain as a corollary a game theoretical proof of the fact that the tropical rank of a matrix, defined as the maximal size of a submatrix for which the optimal assignment problem has a unique solution, coincides with the maximal number of rows (or columns) of the matrix which are linearly independent in the tropical sense. Our proofs rely on techniques from non-linear Perron-Frobenius theory.},
